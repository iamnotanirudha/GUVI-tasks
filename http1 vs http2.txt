HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol,
HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.
 For instance, when someone navigates to certain website like www.guvi.in on their laptop, their web browser sends an 
HTTP request to the Guvi servers for the content that appears on the page. Then, Guvi servers send HTTP responses with
 the text, images, and formatting that the browser displays to the user.

HTTP1 vs HTTP2
1)	In http1, For every TCP connection there is only one request and one response while in htpp2 which uses 
multiplexing, where over a single TCP connection resources to be delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client
 almost at the same time.


2)	http1 uses basic authentication scheme which is unsafe since username and passwords are transmitted in 
clear text or base64 encode where as in http2, security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen 
in HTTP/2. However, it is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type 
Inadequate_Security.


3)	In http1, TCP starts slowly and with domain sharding (resources can be downloaded simultaneously by using 
multiple domains), connection reuse and pipelining, there is an increased risk of network congestion. As for http2 
utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater margin along with being 
less sensitive to network delays.
