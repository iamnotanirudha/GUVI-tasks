Q.1 5 point summary :

1. Parse tree is a 1 to 1 representation of you HTML, which then goes to DOM tree where all the data in form of token is 
   foramtted in form of tree like nodes and rendered.Whenever an HTML element is found, it creates a DOM node

2. After constructing the DOM, the browser reads CSS from all the sources and construct a CSSOM. CSSOM stands for 
   CSS Object Model which is a Tree Like structure just like DOM.

3. Render-Tree is also a tree-like structure constructed by combining DOM and CSSOM trees together. The browser has to
   calculate the layout of each visible element and paint them on the screen, for that browser uses this Render-Tree. Hence,
   unless Render-Tree isnâ€™t constructed, nothing is going to get printed on the screen which is why we need both DOM and 
   CSSOM trees.

4. Layout is a process it computes where the elements will appear on the page based on its relationship with other elements 

5. painting will computes bitmaps and composites these elemts on to the screen, basically will paint the layout and deliver a visual output on the screen
